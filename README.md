If you are using speedtest on your browser, you need to open the speedtest page, wait for it to load (the network may not be very good in your environment), and then click the start button. Speedtest takes time, but you want to do other things than waste your time and energy staring at a boring speed test process, you need to pay attention to whether the speed test is complete and then switch back to the speedtest page, you may want to take a screenshot and share it with others, but the troublesome screenshot selection may make the image contain some ugly edges. speedtest+ takes all that hassle away from you. Speedtest+ focuses on your experience and only cares about how to make you care less about the speed test process, you only want the results, Speedtest+ understands you, Poto understands you.

Q&A

1.Why does my antivirus software reported that this is dangerous software?

There are many antivirus programs and companies in the world, and Poto cannot submit software registration one by one. So the software developed by Poto is not registered for antivirus software, and will therefore be judged as intrusted by antivirus software. This is a misunderstanding.

Please think independently whether you want to use the software developed by Poto.

You can also submit the software developed by Poto to the antivirus software you are using for evaluation.

You may still not trust Poto, and that's okay. You can [sponsor Poto](https://ko-fi.com/ispoto). free is the most expensive, and all the distrust and security threats are because of the interest. When you pay for this, you can also rest assured.



2.How to check the new version?

The software is free to use.

So Poto doesn't get money from it, but it takes a lot of money to build a website. 

Poto is poor, so Poto can't do automatic updates of the software, it has to release the software and version updates through Telegram.

You need to get software version updates through Poto Channel and manually download the new version to complete the override. You can also download and use the new version and delete the old one, and the software developed by Poto is portable, so you don't need to install it and can delete it directly, which is very convenient.
